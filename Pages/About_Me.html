    <p> I am Nikita Tchana I study Angewandte Informatik (applied Computer sciences) at the University of Duisburg-Essen Germany.
        In the course of my studies, I have worked on a good number of projects from a project as small as programming a calculator(on which I worked alone)
        to projects which were tackled by a team of students like developing a banking platform.
        These helped me gain experience in programming and increased my interest in this sector.
        I also worked on some private projects , an example of them being this portfolio i developed
        Learning on a daily basis is what makes understanding programming easy and i do just that to get better at what i love which is programming
        I have good microsoft skills and can speak English, German and French
        side from programming, I love cooking, baking and sewing.

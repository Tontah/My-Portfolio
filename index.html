<div class="About_Me">
  <p> I am Nikita Tchana I study Angewandte Informatik (Applied Computer Sciences) at the University of Duisburg-Essen Germany.
    In the course of my studies, I have worked on a good number of projects from a project as small as programming a calculator(on which I worked alone)
    to projects which were tackled by a team of students like developing a banking platform.
    These helped me gain experience in programming and increased my interest in this sector.
    I also worked on some private projects , an example of them being this portfolio I developed.
    These projects gave me the opportunity to develop in both frontend and backend.
    I have developed a high interest in frontend development and i am working towards getting better at that.
    Learning on a daily basis is what makes understanding programming easy and i do just that to get better at what i love which is programming
    I have good microsoft skills and can speak English, German and French
    side from programming, I love cooking, baking and sewing.
